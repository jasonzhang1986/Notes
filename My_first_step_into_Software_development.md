> As a budding student of computer science, there’s a disconnect between what you learn in class and what you see in the real world. You learn all there is to know about loops of every variety—for, while, do while. You can write a command line based tic-tac-toe game like it’s nobody’s business. And you write so much fill-in-the-blank x86 assembly that it makes your head spin.

作为一名计算机科学的新生，你在课堂上学到的东西和你在现实世界中看到的东西之间存在着脱节。你能写 for, while， do while 循环，可以用命令行写个小游戏，会写令你头疼的 x86 汇编，但这些和业务一毛钱关系都没有。

> But you haven’t the slightest clue how something like Facebook works. Or Reddit. Or YouTube. You don’t even have an inkling of where to begin. When you Google “companies that use python,” since Python is the only language you know, you find people saying things like “Reddit…uses python for their backend.” Backend? What does that even mean?

但你丝毫不知道 Facebook 、 Reddit 或 YouTube 是怎么工作的，你甚至都不知道从哪里开始。当你使用 Google 搜索“使用 Python 的公司”时（因为 Python 是你知道的唯一一种编程语言），你发现人们说诸如“ Reddit....使用 python 作为他们的后端”。 什么是特么的后端？

> There’s this giant gap in your knowledge between writing tic-tac-toe for the command line and building a “real” application, and nobody is telling you how to fill it in. Even though you’ve learned all about how to think logically, you have no idea how to apply what you’ve learned in order to build the things you want to build.

你在使用命令行写小游戏和构建一个真实的应用之间存在着巨大的鸿沟，没人告诉你如何跨过它。即使你已经学会了如何进行逻辑思维，你仍然不知道如何运用你学到的知识来构建你想要构建的。

> Here’s the thing: it takes **initiative** to get to where you want to be. You won’t always have professors giving you templates and boilerplate for all your projects, leaving you to fill in the blanks. You won’t always have a lesson plan telling you “This is what you need to learn next.”

事情是这样的：到达你想要到的地方需要你自己的**主动**。你所有的项目不可能总有一个教授可以给你提供模板或者样板，让你来填补空白。你不会总有一个课程计划来告诉你“这个是接下来要学习的。”

### Takeaway #1:
> **Nobody has more influence over your personal development than you.** It’s up to you to decide what you want to learn, without someone spoon-feeding you the next step every step of the way. This self-directed learning, what Dan Luu might describe as a meta-skill, is one of the most important skills you’ll pick up in your journey towards becoming a software developer.

**没有人比你更能影响你的个人发展。** 这取决于你自己想要学习的东西，而不需要别人为你提供接下来的每一步。这种自我导向的学习，Dan Luu 描述为一种元技能，是你在成为软件开工人员的重要技能之一。

> Luckily, these days we have Google to help out. “How to build a website using python,” you search. You stumble across this nifty little web framework and decide to give it a shot—not that you actually know what a framework is. You try reading the documentation from the beginning, don’t understand any of it (“database abstraction layer?”), and skip ahead to the installation step.

幸运的是，现在我们有谷歌来帮忙。你搜索“如何使用python构建一个网站，”。偶然发现这个漂亮的小框架并决定尝试一下——其实你并不知道什么是框架。您尝试从头开始阅读文档，但毫无头绪(“数据库抽象层?”是什么鬼)，然后直接跳到安装步骤。

> Finally, some actionable steps to follow! You copy the commands into your terminal. There’s something about something called pip, and virtualenv, whatever those are. You take a minute to look those up, just so you have an idea of what you’re doing to your machine.

最后，你跟着操作步骤，pip 、 virtualenv，不管这些是什么东西，你将命令复制到你的终端。你短暂的看一眼这些信息，你似乎知道它们在你电脑上做了什么。

### Takeaway #2:
> **We learn by understanding, not by mindlessly following instructions.** Get used to learning instead of giving up when you don’t understand something, and you’ll see that seemingly impossible tasks are really just greater opportunities to grow—it’s only a question of how long it takes.

**我们通过理解来学习，而不是盲目的遵循指令。** 当你遇到不明白的东西的时候要习惯学习而不是就此放弃，你会发现，看似不可能完成的任务其实是一个更大的成长机会，问题仅仅是它需要花费多久的时间。

> Okay, looks like pip is a utility to install packages so you can import them, just like we import the built-in math package. Virtualenv seems like a way to isolate package installations to a specific project. You still don’t fully understand any of the commands besides mkdir and cd, but you‘re not totally clueless either. Time to move on to the quick start guide.

看起来 pip 是一个用来安装包的工具，所以你可以导入它们，就像我们导入内置的数学包一样。Virtualenv 似乎是将包安装隔离到特定项目的一种方法。除了 mkdir 和 cd 之外，你仍然不能完全理解其他命令，但是你也不是完全没有头绪。是时候转向快速入门指南了。

> You follow the initial instructions, and there’s a burst of elation when you run your program and see “Hello, world” in your browser for the first time. You think to yourself, now this is what I’m talking about! No more boring old command line programs for me! It’s a small step, to be sure, but that’s your code in the browser, and that’s significant.

你按照说明进行操作，当你运行程序并在浏览器中第一次看到 “Hello, world” 的时候，你会兴奋不已。你默默的对自己说，这才是我想要的，而不是那些无聊的命令行小程序。这是迈出的很小的一步，但重要的是它是在浏览器里运行的代码。

> You continue, but start running into a lot of concepts that you don’t fully understand. Routes? HTTP? GET? POST? And what are rendering templates? Some of these terms seem vaguely familiar, but you don’t actually know what they mean, so you stop along the way to look them up. Just like you learned about pip and virtualenv, you start to assemble a fuzzy picture of how this application is working.

你继续学习，但是开始遇到很多你不完全理解的概念。Routes? HTTP? GET？ POST？还有什么是 rendering 模板? 这些术语有些似曾相识，但你并不真正了解它们的意思，所以你就停下来去查它们。就像你了解了 pip 和 virtualenv，你开始对这个应用程序的工作方式有了模糊的认识。

### Takeaway #3:
Learning takes practice. Just like any other skill, it needs to be honed. And just like any other **practiced** skill, it can become a habit. Seize every opportunity you have to learn. Remember: success begets success. Make learning a habit, and not only will your personal growth skyrocket, but your desire to learn will grow as well.

You can use templates to display content like you would with any other HTML/CSS page, but the content is dynamic. You can control what content is displayed at different URLs by defining routes. You can even fetch content from other websites to use in your own application!

As you get more and more comfortable, you start to feel a degree of control and pride in your independent learning that you’ve never felt while working on any of your class projects. You feel empowered. Who even needs school, anyway?

As you gain confidence, the guide starts to feel a little…basic. It is, after all, a quick start guide. I could do something cooler than this, you think.

So you strike out on your own. You set up your project the same way you did before, with pip and virtualenv, because that’s the only way you know how to set up a project. You know how to set up the templates. You know how to set up the routes, the HTTP requests, the GETs and the POSTs. You might even dare to use a third party API and practice reading some more documentation. You still don’t understand everything, but you’re learning, bit by bit.

And finally, you build your very first independent side project. Not the result of a tutorial that hundreds of budding developers before you have followed. Not a class assignment that thousands of students before you have done. A real, tangible, honest-to-goodness application that would not exist had you not built it. **And that’s an amazing feeling.**

So what’s next? Now that you’ve built an application, how do you put it online so everyone can use it? What really is a “back end?” A front end?

Here’s the great thing about fostering a desire to learn: there’s always more. It’s like an amazing television series that you can never get enough of—**and it never ends.** There’s no such thing as learning too much. Every discipline in software development is an entire new world to dive into, and the more you learn, the more worlds are opened up to you.

At some point, you realize that there is no single canonical path to being a “real” software developer. There’s not enough time to master every single thing. Everyone’s path to success is totally unique. **It’s entirely up to you to forge a path to the destination you want to reach.**

This was the story of my own first step into the world of software development. If you want to see the very first side project that I ever built, you can check it out here.

And if you feel like sharing your own, feel free to post a link in a response! I’m always curious to see what kind of code people start out writing.
